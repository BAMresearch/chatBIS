## Dataset archiving





openBIS supports archiving of datasets to Strongbox
(https://www.strongboxdata.com/) as
described in Datasets
Archiving





This needs to be set up and configured on system level.





To trigger archiving manually from the ELN, navigate to a dataset and
use the Request or disallow archiving button, as shown below.

















Please note that the strongbox has a minimum size requirement of
10GB. If a single dataset is below this threshold it will be queued
for archiving and it will be archived only when additional datasets in
the same Space/Project/Experiment are selected for archiving and the
minimum size is reached. All datasets are bundled together and archived
together. This implies that if unarchiving is requested for one dataset
in a bundle, all other datasets will also be unarchived.






### Dataset archiving helper tool





If you wish to archive multiple datasets, you can use the Archiving
Helper tool under Utilities in the main menu. You can search for
datasets and select multiple ones to be archived, by clicking the
Request Archiving button on the top of the page.








It is possible to search datasets by size, by selecting Property in
the Field Type, Size (bytes)[ATTR.SIZE]  in the Field Name
and the desired Comparator Operator, as shown below.











## Dataset unarchiving





Once the dataset is archived on tapes, the button on the dataset page
changes to Unarchive, as shown below. Datasets can be unarchived by
using this button.















### Dataset unarchiving helper tool





To unarchive several datasets it is possible to use the Unarchiving
Helper tool, under Utilities in the main menu, as shown below. You
can search for datasets and select multiple ones to be unarchived, using
the Unarchive button on tope of the page.
