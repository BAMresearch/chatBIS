# Additional Functionalities



## Print PDF


For every entity in openBIS it is possible to generate a pdf using the Print PDF option from the More.. dropdown menu.


The generated pdf file can be printed or downloaded from the browser.


An example for a Space is shown in the picture below.







## Visualise Relationships


Parent-child relationships between Objects can be visualised as trees
or tables in the ELN.


To see the genealogical tree, select the Hierarchy Graph option from the More… dropdown in an entity form.











Large trees can be pruned, by selecting how many levels of parents
and/or children and which types to show.








To view the genealogy of an Object in a tabular format, select the Hierarchy Table option from the More… dropdown.




## Tables


All tables in the ELN have a similar format and functionalities. The
tables have been redesigned for the 20.10.3 release of openBIS.


Here we give an overview of the main functionalities of the tables.






### Filters


Two filter options are available form the Filters button: Filter
Per Column and Global Filter. The first allows to filter on
individual columns, or multiple columns, whereas the second filters
terms across the entire table using the AND or OR operator.










### Sorting


It is possible to sort individual columns or also multiple columns. For
multi-column sorting, you should click on the column header and press
the Cmd keyboard key. The order of sorting is shown by a number in
each column, as shown below.










### Exports


Tables can be exported in different ways, using the export button shown
below.









- Import Compatible:

Yes: in this case some columns which are incompatible
with imports (i.e. registration date, registrator,
modification date, modifier) are not exported even if
selected; some columns that are required by openBIS for
imports are added to the exported file even if not
selected (i.e. code, identifier, $ column). Moreover text
fields are exported in HTML, to keep the formatting upon
import.
No: in this case all columns or selected columns are
exported.

















2. Columns:


- All (default order). All columns are exported, in
accordance with the selection explained above for import
compatibility.
Selected (shown order). Selected columns are exported,
in accordance with the selection explained above for
import compatibility.











3. Rows:


- All Pages. All pages of the table are exported.
Current Page. Only the currently visible page of
the table is exported.
Selected Rows. Only selected rows in the table are
exported.








4. Value:


- Plain Text. Text fields are exported in plain text,
without any formatting. This option is not available if
the export is import-compatible.
Rich Text. Text fields are exported in HTML format.











Tables are exported to XLS format. Exported tables can be used for
updates via the XLS Batch Update Objects.



Note: Excel has a character limit of 32767 characters in each cell. If you export entries where a field exceeds this limit, you get a warning and the exported Excel file will not contain the content of the cell which is above this limit and the cell is highlighted in red, as shown below.










### Columns


Users can select which properties to display in the table clicking on
the Columns button. It is also possible to show all properties or
hide all properties. The position of the columns can also be changed by
placing the cursor next to the = sign in the list and moving the fields.
This information is stored in the database for each user.












#### Spreadsheets


If a table contains Objects which have a spreadsheet field which is
filled in, a spreadsheet icon is displayed in the table. Upon clicking
on the icon, the content of the spreadsheet can be expanded.




















#### Text fields


If a table contains Objects which have long text fields, only the
beginning of the text is shown and can be expanded. If the text contains
a picture or a table, an icon is shown in the table and the content of
the text becomes visible by clicking on the icon.


















### Selection of entries in table


Single entries in a table can be selected using the checkbox in the row.
By clicking the checkbox in the table header, all entries of the table
are selected. After selection of entries, some actions become available:



- Delete: allows to move the selected entries to the trashcan.

- Move: allows to move the selected entries to a different existing
Collection/Experiment or to a new one.

- Generate barcodes: allows to generate custom barcodes for the
selected entries.

- Update custom barcodes/QR codes: allows to update existing custom
barcodes of the selected entries.

- Clear selection: allows to clear the selection made.













In Object tables inside Experiments/Collections there is an
Operations column, which allow users to perform certain tasks on an
Object:



- Upload a file to the Object

- Move the Object to another exiting Experiment/Collection.

- Update Barcode/QR code.

- Open the hierarchy graph. This is the graph showing parent/child
connections of the Object.

- Open the hierarchy table. This is the table showing parent/child
connections of the Object.













## Browse Entries by Type


The Object Browser under the Utilities main menu allows to see
all entries of the same type and all Experimental Steps, which may be
contained in different Experiments/Collections and Projects.





This is useful when there are entries of a certain type that belong to
different Collections (e.g. protocols of the same type stored in two
different protocol collections), or to have an overview of all
Experimental Steps, independently of the Experiment they belong to.








From the Object Browser page, it is also possible to Batch
register or Batch update Objects using an XLS or TSV template.
















## Trashcan


When Experiments, Objects and Datasets are deleted, they are moved
to the openBIS trashcan, under the Utilities main menu. Items
can be removed from the trashcan only by someone with Space admin or
Instance admin role. Deletion from the trashcan is IRREVERSIBLE.





Note: Spaces and Projects are directly permanently deleted, they are
not moved to the trashcan first.





To empty the whole trashcan, click the blue Empty Trash button above the table.


To delete permanently single entries choose one of two options from the
Operations dropdown:





- delete permanently: deletes permanently only the selected entry.

- delete permanently (including dependent deletions): if the
selected entry had children which are also in the trashcan, this
option allows to permanently delete both the entry and its children.






If one entity was unintentionally deleted, the operation can be reverted
at this stage by choosing the Revert Deletions option from
the Operations drop down in the table.










## Visualize Available Storage Space


The storage space available in an openBIS instance can be visualized by navigating to Other Tools in the navigation menu and clicking on the Show available storage space button.





Before uploading large datasets, the available storage space should always be checked.




## Vocabulary Browser


The Vocabulary browser is accessible from the Utilities main
menu. This shows all controlled vocabularies registered in openBIS and
the terms they contain. Vocabularies are predefined lists of values to
choose from in given fields. Vocabularies can be created/modified by an
openBIS Instance admin (see New Entity Type
Registration).


This information is needed for filling the forms for Batch
Upload orBatch Update of Objects via TSV file. If an Object
has a property of type Controlled Vocabulary, the codes of the
vocabulary have to be entered in the .tsv template file. This is not the
case for XLS Batch registration or update, where labels can be used.










## Freeze Entities


Each level of the openBIS hierarchy (Space, Project,
Experiment/Collection, Object, Dataset) can be frozen, so it can be no
longer edited and/or deleted.


At every level, everything contained underneath is selected by default
to be frozen. E.g. if I choose to freeze a Space, everything contained
in the Space is automatically selected to be frozen. Single entities can
be manually unselected.


A Space admin role is necessary to freeze entities in a given Space.


IMPORTANT: the freezing is IRREVERSIBLE!


This operation cannot be undone from any UI, not even by an Instance admin. Please freeze entities only when you are absolutely sure that
they should not be further modified!



### How to freeze an entity


At each level of the openBIS hierarchy (Space, Project,
Experiment/Collection, Object, Dataset) the Freeze Entity option is
available under the More.. dropdown menu. See the example for a
Space below.

















If you select this, a list of entities contained or connected to the one
selected will be presented to you, as shown below. By default everything
is selected, so you need to unselect entries that you do not want to
freeze.














To freeze one or several entities, you need to provide your login
password and save.

## Navigation menu





openBIS 20.10.6 features a new navigation menu.











This has the following functionalities:





1.Filter. You can filter the menu by names or codes.














2. Root nodes. If you do not want to navigate the full menu, but
only a section of it, you can set the section you want to navigate as
root node, by clicking the icon shown in the picture below.











This now becomes the root node, as shown below. To restore the full menu
view, you can click on the root node icon shown below.








3. Sorting. The default sorting of the menu is in alphabetical. It
is now possible to sort separately individual sections of the menu
(ELN, Inventory, Stock) and individual nodes inside those sections. It
is possible to do a custom sorting by moving around (drag&drop) entities
in the menu. Please note that this is only possible inside a given
level, i.e. you can re-organise Objects inside a
Collection/Experiment; Collections/Experiments inside a Project;
Projects inside a Space. However, you cannot move entities from one
level to another, i.e. you cannot move an Object to a different
Collection/Experiment; a Collection/Experiment to a different
Project; a Project to a different Space. This can only be done
from the Move option under the More.. dropdown menu in the
forms.























4. Collapse/Expand. The full menu or individual nodes can be
expanded or collapsed, with the button shown below.

















5. Scroll to selected node. In some cases, the view in the main ELN
page does not correspond to an entry selected in the menu. You can
scroll to the selected node in the menu, using the button shown below.











The state of the menu is saved. Every time you change something in the
menu, this change will be saved and when you login next time you will
see the menu in the state you last saved it.




## Custom Imports





From openBIS version 20.10.4, Custom Imports, previously available only
in the core UI, are available in the ELN UI.





Custom imports allow users to import metadata in a custom way, by using
a dropbox script in the background. You can use this if you want to
parse a file in a given format and import the information from this file
as metadata in openBIS.





Custom imports are not available by default, but need to be enabled on
the server side by a system admin, and a dropbox script needs to be
associated with an import (see Custom
Imports).





If one or more custom imports are configured in openBIS, the Custom
Import option is available under the Utilities in the main
menu.


The available custom imports can be selected from the Custom Import
Service drop down menu in the Custom Import page (see below).











If the available custom import provides a template that can be used as
input for the import, the template will be available to download from
the Custom Import page.











If the custom import is not configured to provide a template, no
download link is shown in the Custom Import page.













## Entity history





Whenever an entity of type Collection/Experiment, Object or
Dataset is modified in openBIS, the changes are stored in the
database. The stored changes are modifications to property fields,
addition and deletion of parents/children for Objects and Datasets,
changes of Space/Project/Experiment/Object ownership if an entity is
moved.


The History of changes of each entity is now available in the ELN
UI. In versions prior to openBIS 20.10.3 this was only available in the
core UI.









### History table for Collections





In a Collection page, the History can be accessed from the
More.. dropdown list.











The History table shows the version number of the changes, the
author of the changes, the changes made (with the values before- in red,
and after the change – in green), and the timestamp, i.e. the time when
the changes were made.





For a Collection, the PermID (Permanent Identifier) of the
Project it belongs to is shown. If a Collection is moved from one
Project to another, the PermID of the old and new Projects are shown
in the history table.














The show option in Full Document shows the full metadata of the
entry (not only the changed fields) when changes were applied. This is
displayed in JSON format.
















### History table for Objects





For every Object, the history of changes can be accessed from the
More.. dropdown on the Object page.














For an Object, the PermID (Permanent Identifier) of the
Collection it belongs to is shown. If an Object is moved from one
Collection to another, the PermID of the old and new Collections are
shown in the history table.







### History table for Datasets





For every dataset, the history of changes can be accessed from the
More.. dropdown on the Dataset page.











For a Dataset, the PermID (Permanent Identifier) of the
Object/Collection it belongs to is shown. If a Dataset is moved
from one Object/Collection to another, the PermID of the old and new
Objects/Collections are shown in the history table.





## Spreadsheet


The spreadsheet component needs to be enabled by a group admin or lab manager who can edit the ELN Settings, as described here: Enable Rich Text Editor or Spreadsheet Widgets





The spreadsheet supports some basic Excel functionalities, such as mathematical formulas (e.g. =SUM(A1+A2)).
It is possible to import an openBIS Object into the spreadsheet, with the import button, on the spreadsheet itself:





Please note that if the Object is updated in openBIS, it will NOT be automatically updated in the spreadsheet.




## Session Token


When users log in to openBIS, a session token is generated. The session token is visible in the ELN UI, under the User Profile, in the navigation menu.








The session token is needed to connect to openBIS via pyBIS or obis, in cases where SSO (e.g. SWITCHaai) is used for authentication. See pyBIS.
