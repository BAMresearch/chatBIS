# Managing Storage Of Samples



## Allocate storage positions to samples


If we want to track the storage position of samples, openBIS provides a
graphical overview of lab storages.


Lab storages need to be configured by a lab manager or group admin,
as explained here: Configure Lab
Storage


This can be done in two ways:


- add storage information on the sample form during (or after) sample
registration

- batch register storage positions for several samples




### Register storage position for a single sample





1. Navigate to the Storage section, at the bottom of the sample
form. Click the + New Storage Positions above the table, as shown
below:





- In the widget that opens, select the appropriate Storage from the
dropdown menu. Storage must be configured by a lab manager or group
admin as explained in Configure Lab
Storages






3. Select the position in the storage (shelf and rack).


4. If the sample is in a box, provide a Box Name.


5. Select the Box Size form the list of configured sizes (the list
can be configured by an Instance Admin).


6. Select the Position in the box.


7. Click Accept.






#### Add additional metadata to storage positions


By default, the storage only keeps track of locations. If the Storage
Position has been configured by an Instance admin to have additional
metadata (e.g. freezing date), these can be added by clicking on the
link in the storage table, as shown below. The link becomes available
after saving the sample.











The additional information can be entered in the Storage Position
Object form.





### Batch register storage positions



#### XLS Batch Registration


With the new XLS batch registration, samples and their storage positions
can be registered in one transaction using the XLS template file, as
explained in Batch register entries in a
Collection.







#### Batch Registration with TSV file


Storage positions are modelled in openBIS as children of other entries.
To register the positions for several samples with the Batch
Registration using the .tsv template, first the parent samples need to
be registered in openBIS. In a second step, the positions are assigned.


To assign storage positions in batch mode follow the steps below:



- Select Storage positions from the Batch Registration drop
down menu.

- Download the template file.

- Remove the identifier column from the file (identifiers need
to be automatically generated by openBIS).

- Fill in the parents column. These are the identifiers of the
samples for which we want to register the storage
positions(/MATERIALS/PROJECT/OBJECT_CODE).

- Fill the remaining information about the storage positions.

- Save the file and upload with the Batch Registration.

## Batch update storage positions





To update several storage positions, we can use the batch update option
from the Object Browser:





- Go to the Object Browser under Utilities in the main menu

- Select the object type Storage Position from the dropdown menu
(see picture)

- Use the table Filter to select the storage positions you want to
update
(see Tables)

- Export the table (see
Tables)

- Edit the file to make the changes needed (e.g. change the name of a
box, change the storage, change a box position, change box size etc)

- Select XLS Batch Update Objects from the More.. dropdown.






7. Import the file you modified before and update the storage
positions.

## Delete storage positions






### Delete single storage positions





To delete a single storage position from a sample:





- Edit the sample for which you want to deleted the storage position

- Navigate to the Storage section at the end of the page

- Use the “–” button in the Storage Position table, as shown
in the picture

- Save the sample









Please note that the storage position deleted in this way is moved to
the trashcan. To delete the position permanently, this has to be deleted
from the trashcan (see
Trashcan).










### Remove one of multiple positions in the same box





If one sample has been assigned to multiple positions in the same box
and you need to remove only one or some of them, you can follow these
steps:





- Edit the sample for which you need to remove the storage
position in the box

- Navigate to the Storage section at the end of the page

- Click on the table row (see picture below)

- Unselect the position you want to remove (eg. A5 in the example below)

- Click Accept

- Save the sample














### Delete multiple storage positions





To delete multiple storage positions from multiple samples we can use
the Object Browser.





- Go to the Object Browser under Utilities in the main menu

- Select Storage Position from the Object Type dropdown












3. Filter the table to find the storage positions you want to
delete
(see Tables)


4. Select the positions you want to delete from the table and click the
Delete button (see picture below)


5. You will be asked to provide a reason for deletion


6. The deleted storage positions will be moved to the trashcan and
should be removed from there to be permanently deleted (see
Trashcan)

## Overview of lab storages


The Storage Manager, under Utilities, provides an overview of
each single storage configured for the lab, by the lab admin.






- Select the storage containing the samples to visualise from the
Storage drop down menu.

- Click on a box to view its content.

- When hovering with the mouse over a sample inside a box, the info
about the sample is shown.

### Change storage position of samples


The Storage Manager can also be used to move samples from one
storage position to another, if the location of the sample is changed:



- Click on Toggle Storage B (see figure above).

- Select the destination storage, from the Storage drop down
menu.

- Drag and drop the box or sample to move from Storage A to the
desired position in Storage B. Please note that the move
operation for samples with multiple positions in the same box or
in different boxes is not supported.

- Changes are visualised at the bottom of the page. To save them,
click Save Changes on top of the Storage Manager form.
