Tables can be exported in different ways, using the export button shown
below.

- Import Compatible:

Yes: in this case some columns which are incompatible
with imports (i.e. registration date, registrator,
modification date, modifier) are not exported even if
selected; some columns that are required by openBIS for
imports are added to the exported file even if not
selected (i.e. code, identifier, $ column). Moreover text
fields are exported in HTML, to keep the formatting upon
import.
No: in this case all columns or selected columns are
exported.

When Experiments, Objects and Datasets are deleted, they are moved
to the openBIS trashcan, under the Utilities main menu. Items
can be removed from the trashcan only by someone with Space admin or
Instance admin role. Deletion from the trashcan is IRREVERSIBLE.

Note: Spaces and Projects are directly permanently deleted, they are
not moved to the trashcan first.

To empty the whole trashcan, click the blue Empty Trash button above the table.


To delete permanently single entries choose one of two options from the
Operations dropdown:

- delete permanently: deletes permanently only the selected entry.

- delete permanently (including dependent deletions): if the
selected entry had children which are also in the trashcan, this
option allows to permanently delete both the entry and its children.

the terms they contain. Vocabularies are predefined lists of values to
choose from in given fields. Vocabularies can be created/modified by an
openBIS Instance admin (see New Entity Type
Registration).


This information is needed for filling the forms for Batch
Upload orBatch Update of Objects via TSV file. If an Object
has a property of type Controlled Vocabulary, the codes of the
vocabulary have to be entered in the .tsv template file. This is not the
case for XLS Batch registration or update, where labels can be used.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_additional-functionalities.html_11

Each level of the openBIS hierarchy (Space, Project,
Experiment/Collection, Object, Dataset) can be frozen, so it can be no
longer edited and/or deleted.


At every level, everything contained underneath is selected by default
to be frozen. E.g. if I choose to freeze a Space, everything contained
in the Space is automatically selected to be frozen. Single entities can
be manually unselected.


A Space admin role is necessary to freeze entities in a given Space.


IMPORTANT: the freezing is IRREVERSIBLE!


This operation cannot be undone from any UI, not even by an Instance admin. Please freeze entities only when you are absolutely sure that
they should not be further modified!",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_additional-functionalities.html_12

3. Sorting. The default sorting of the menu is in alphabetical. It
is now possible to sort separately individual sections of the menu
(ELN, Inventory, Stock) and individual nodes inside those sections. It
is possible to do a custom sorting by moving around (drag&drop) entities
in the menu. Please note that this is only possible inside a given
level, i.e. you can re-organise Objects inside a
Collection/Experiment; Collections/Experiments inside a Project;
Projects inside a Space. However, you cannot move entities from one
level to another, i.e. you cannot move an Object to a different
Collection/Experiment; a Collection/Experiment to a different
Project; a Project to a different Space. This can only be done

From openBIS version 20.10.4, Custom Imports, previously available only
in the core UI, are available in the ELN UI.

Custom imports allow users to import metadata in a custom way, by using
a dropbox script in the background. You can use this if you want to
parse a file in a given format and import the information from this file
as metadata in openBIS.

Custom imports are not available by default, but need to be enabled on
the server side by a system admin, and a dropbox script needs to be
associated with an import (see Custom
Imports).

If one or more custom imports are configured in openBIS, the Custom
Import option is available under the Utilities in the main
menu.


The available custom imports can be selected from the Custom Import
Service drop down menu in the Custom Import page (see below).

If the available custom import provides a template that can be used as
input for the import, the template will be available to download from
the Custom Import page.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_additional-functionalities.html_19

Additional Functionalities,https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/additional-functionalities.html,"## Entity history

Whenever an entity of type Collection/Experiment, Object or
Dataset is modified in openBIS, the changes are stored in the
database. The stored changes are modifications to property fields,
addition and deletion of parents/children for Objects and Datasets,
changes of Space/Project/Experiment/Object ownership if an entity is
moved.


The History of changes of each entity is now available in the ELN
UI. In versions prior to openBIS 20.10.3 this was only available in the
core UI.

### History table for Collections

In a Collection page, the History can be accessed from the
More.. dropdown list.

The History table shows the version number of the changes, the
author of the changes, the changes made (with the values before- in red,
and after the change – in green), and the timestamp, i.e. the time when
the changes were made.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_additional-functionalities.html_21

When a sample is registered, a barcode is automatically generated by
openBIS. This is found in the Identification info section, as shown
below.

This barcode can be printed and the label can be added to the vial
containing the sample. The option to print the barcode is under the 
More.. menu

If a sample already has its own barcode or QR code, it is possible to scan this with
a scanner or the camera of a mobile device and assign it to the sample.
This can be done after registration of a sample, with the Custom
Barcode/QR Code Update option under the More.. drop down.

Barcodes and QR codes,https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/barcodes.html,"## Printer and Barcode Scanner Requirements

### Printers


There are several manufacturers of printers and different kinds of
barcodes and paper to adapt to different use cases. Most manufacturers
have their own proprietary printer driver and language for labels.


To allow freedom of choice for the barcode printer, the openBIS ELN-LIMS
allows to configure both the type of barcodes and the layout and size of
the labels. openBIS uses this information to produce a PDF document,
thus having as single requirement that the printer driver used allows to
print PDF documents using applications such as Adobe Acrobat Reader or
Preview (Mac).

#### Printer Configuration


There are different types of printer drivers. The two types we can
define as generic are PS (PostScript) (recommended) and PCL
(Printer Command Language). Printers with these drivers are likely to
print PDF documents and other types of documents with embedded fonts,
images, etc…",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_barcodes.html_3
Barcodes and QR codes,https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/barcodes.html,"## Printer and Barcode Scanner Requirements

### Printers




The printer paper type needs to be configured for each printer. Two
layouts are supported:


- Split: The PDF will contain separate pages with each barcode.

- Continuous: The PDF will contain a continuous layout with the
barcodes. More uncommon for this applications.

The printer paper size needs to be configured for each printer. It is
possible to indicate the size of the barcode, so it can fit.


#### Printer testing


We provide two example documents that can be used to test the printer.


- Split barcodes example PDF:
printer-test-code128-split-50-15

- Continuous barcodes example PDF:

### Printers



Please consider that these examples likely do not correspond to the
particular paper size of the printer being evaluated and as such the
barcodes may look squashed. In order to obtain optimal results, the
paper size would need to be configured. However, for the test it is
enough to verify that the printer can print those files.


#### Printer Advice before purchasing


Before purchasing a printer, we recommend to check with the manufacturer
that the barcode printer provides a general driver and that it can print
one of the documents provided as example above.


#### Tested Printers


- Zebra ZD420


### Scanners


There are several manufacturers of barcode scanners. In most cases
scanners act as a keyboard for the computer, so when the barcode scanner
scans a barcode it will type whatever has been scanned.

Barcodes and QR codes,https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/barcodes.html,"## Printer and Barcode Scanner Requirements


### Scanners




The scanner keyboard layout should be the same as the computer used. If
not this could cause problems if there are any special characters.


#### Scanner testing


Open a notepad and scan the barcodes provided in the examples below. The
scanner should read them and type the correct output.


- Barcode Code 128.
scanner-test-code128-50-15.
This should give as output “20210720122856003-454071” without

### 1. Import-compatible export of a Space selecting all options


We select all options from the export widget, as shown below.

We export a Space called CATERINA in the Lab Notebook with all its sublevels (see below).

One Object in this Space has a parent in a Space called METHODS (see below).

The exported zip file contains 3 folders:


A. data folder


This contains the datasets in the correct format to be uploaded via eln-lims dropbox, as shown below.

B. hiearchy folder",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_data-export.html_4

### 1. Import-compatible export of a Space selecting all options




This contains folders that match the openBIS hierarchy (Space/Project/Experiment/Object).


In this case 2 Space folders are present:


- CATERINA: is the exported space.

- METHODS: contains an Object which is parent of an Object in the Space CATERINA. This was exported because the option Include Objects and Datasets parents and children from different spaces was selected for export.

Inside each folder, there is a pdf of the corresponding entity. Example:


- in the Space folder CATERINA there is a CATERINA.pdf file that contains the metadata of the Space;

- in the Project folder PROJECT_1 there is a PROJECT_1.pdf file that contains the metadata of the Project;

- in the Experiment folder My second experiment (PROJECT_1_EXP_1) there is a My second experiment (PROJECT_1_EXP_1).pdf file with the metadata of the Experiment;",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_data-export.html_5

C. xlsx folder.


This contains:


- a metadata.xlsx file which has the metadata of the exported entities and the corresponding masterdata (types and properties) in the correct format to be re-imported in another openBIS instance;

- a scripts folder that contains evaluation plugins associated to two types defined in the metadata.xlsx file. This folder is present only if the exported types have plugins associated with them.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_data-export.html_6

This folder is present only if the exported entities contain information in spreadsheet or if there are text fields with more than 32,767 characters (this is the limit of the Excel cells).

- a miscellaneous folder that contains images that are embedded in text fields of the exported entities. This folder is present only if exported entities contain images embedded in text.


### 2. Non import-compatible export of a Space selecting all options


We export the same Space as described in Example 1, with all options selected, but the export this time is not import-compatible, as shown below.

In this case the exported zip file contains only 2 folders: hierarchy and xlsx. Data are exported inside the hierachy folder, instead of being in a separate data folder.

In addition, in this case, inside the Object Step A (EXP4) folder there is a data folder that contains the dataset belonging to this Object, as shown below. The metadata of the dataset is provided as a metadata.json file inside the data folder and as pdf file inside the Object folder (Step A (EXP4)).

B. xlsx folder


This contains the same files and folders as described in Example 1 (see below). The only difference in this case is that the metadata.xlsx is not import-compatible.

openBIS provides an integration with the Zenodo data
repository (https://zenodo.org/).


This enables data direct data transfer from openBIS to Zenodo. First of
all the connection to Zenodo needs to be configured on system level

Web upload of data files is only suitable for files of limited size (few GB). To upload larger data, openBIS uses dropbox scripts that run in the background (see Dropboxes). A default dropbox script is provided with the openBIS ELN-LIMS plugin, and the dropbox folder needs to be set up by a system admin.


If this is available, users need to organise their data in a specific way:


Folder 1


Data (can be single files or folders)

Folder 1 needs to have a specific name that encodes the information
of where the data should be uploaded to openBIS.


The name of Folder 1 can be generated from the ELN interface:

Enter the name of your dataset (optional, but recommended);
Copy the generated name of the folder using the copy to clipboard icon.

3. In your finder/explorer, create a new folder and paste the name you
copied from openBIS. Place your data in this folder.

4. Place this folder containing your data inside the
eln-lims-dropbox folder. openBIS continuously monitors this folder
and when data are placed here, they are moved to the final storage.
The move happens after a predefined (and customisable) inactivity period

In case of uploads of data >100GB we recommend to configure the
eln-lims-dropbox-marker. The set up and configuration need to be
done by a system admin. The process of data preparation is the same as
described above, however in this case the data move to the openBIS final
storage only starts when a markerfile is placed in the
eln-lims-dropbox-marker folder. The marker file is an empty file with
this name: .MARKER_is_finished_. Please note the “.” at the start of the name, which indicates that this is a hidden file. This file should also not have any extension. For example, if the folder to be uploaded has the following name:

to be provided in a file called metadata.json. This file should be
placed inside the folder with the openBIS-generated name described
above, together with the data. This is shown in the example below.

is the folder with the openBIS-generated name. Inside this folder there
is the metadata.json file, and the data, which consists of a few files
and 2 folders.

The openBIS platform has three primary functionalities:


- Inventory management of laboratory samples, materials,
protocols, equipment.

- Laboratory notebook, to document lab experiments.

- Data management, to store all data related to lab experiments
(raw, processed, analysed data, scripts, Jupyter notebooks, etc.).

It is possible to use all functionalities or only selected ones.

In the most general use-case, the Inventory is shared by all lab
members, so everyone can access information about available lab
materials and regularly used protocols.


In addition, every lab member has a personal folder in the Lab
notebook, where to organise projects and experiments. This folder can
be shared with other lab members or collaborators with openBIS access.
Experimental steps described in the lab notebook can be linked to
protocols and samples stored in the inventory. Experimental steps can
also be linked to each other.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_general-overview.html_0

Inventory Of Materials And Methods,https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html#rules-to-follow-to-fill-in-the-template-tsv-file,"# Inventory Of Materials And Methods


The default Inventory contains two folders: Materials and Methods.


These are used to organise respectively samples and materials of any type and lab protocols.


Samples, materials and protocols are modelled in openBIS as Objects.


In the openBIS ELN-LIMS for life sciences, the following Object types are provided:


Antibodies, Chemicals, Enzymes, Media, Solutions and Buffers, Plasmids, Plants, Oligos, RNAs, Bacteria, Cell lines, Flies, Yeasts, General protocols, PCR protocols, Western blotting protocols.


These Objects are organised in Collections in the Materials and Methods sections of the Inventory.


The generic openBIS ELN-LIMS only has one predefined Object type for the Inventory, General Protocol, in the General Protocols Collection in the Methods folder. The Material folder is empty. Additional Object types and Collections must be created by an openBIS instance admin, based on the needs of the lab(s).",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html_0
Inventory Of Materials And Methods,https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html#rules-to-follow-to-fill-in-the-template-tsv-file,"## Customise Collection View


It is possible customise the view of Collections in the ELN.


The default Collection can have a Form View or a List View.
Depending on this selection, the collection view will be different.

Form View: This shows the metadata of the Collection along with
the table of objects. This view is useful when a user wants to see
specific metadata for a Collection.


If you do not see the table with the Objects in the form, you need to
enable this by selecting Show Objects from the More.. dropdown

List View: The metadata of the Collection is not shown in this
view, but only the table of objects is shown.

In this case a user would need to click on More.., and Edit
Collection in order to see the metadata and be able to edit the
Collection.

In this example, we will see how to register one Object of type
Sample in the Raw Samples Collection. The same procedure
should be followed to register any other Object in other
Collections.


- Click on the Raw Samples Collection folder in the main menu.

- Click the New Sample in the main page

- Fill in the form

- Save

Please note that the Object type shown in the +New button (in this
case Sample), is what is defined as default object type for the
Collection. If this is missing in the Collection, the button will
not be present.

To register a different object type in the Collection:


- Select New Object from the More drop down menu (as shown
below)

- Select the relevant Object type from the list (Sample, in this case).

- Fill in the form

- Save

It is possible to register several samples at once via file upload. Two
methods are currently available:


- Batch registration via Excel template file (XLS Batch Register
Objects)

- Batch registration via TSV template file (TSV Batch Register
Objects)


### Batch registration via Excel template file


To register several entries of the same type with an Excel file:


- Navigate to the relevant collection (e.g. Samples).

- Select XLS Batch Register Objects from the More drop-down menu (see figure above)

- Download the template file and fill in the relevant information.
(Example file: SAMPLE-COLLECTION-REGISTRATION-SAMPLE-STORAGE_POSITION-template)

- Upload the file.


#### Codes",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html_3

### Batch registration via Excel template file




In most cases, Object types have the option to auto-generate codes set
to true in the admin UI. In this case, openBIS automatically generates
codes and identifiers when Objects are registered. If that is not the
case, the code needs to be manually entered by the users in the Excel
template. The current template does not have a Code column. This can
however be manually added if codes should be provided by the user and
not automatically generated by openBIS.  If codes should be manually
entered and are missing, openBIS will show the error message
“UserFailureExceptionmessage: Code cannot be empty for a non auto
generated code.”


#### Controlled vocabularies


For Controlled Vocabularies fields, i.e. fields with a drop down menu,
you can enter either the code or the label of the terms in the
Excel file.


Please note that codes are not case-sensitive, but labels are.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html_4

### Batch registration via Excel template file




Codes and labels of vocabulary terms can be seen under
Utilities -> Vocabulary Browser.


#### Assign parents


- Assign already existing parents

If the parents you want to assign to your Objects are already registered
in openBIS, in the Parents column of the Excel file, you can assign
the relationship, by providing the identifier of the parent (i.e. /SPACE
code/PROJECT code/OBJECT code). If you want to add multiple parents to
one Object, every identifier should be in a new line in the
corresponding Excel cell. A new line in an Excel cell is entered with
the keyboard shortcuts Alt + Enter.


Example file:
SAMPLE-COLLECTION-REGISTRATION-ANTIBODY-STORAGE_POSITION-template


Note: no other separators (e.g “,” or  “;”) should be used,
otherwise an error will be thrown.

### Batch registration via Excel template file



If you want to register a few Objects and at the same time establish a
parent-child relationship between some of them, you can do so by using
the $ and Parents columns. In the example below we want to
register 2 Objects, antibody 1 and antibody 2. We want to assign
antibody 1 as parent of antibody 2. In the $ column corresponding to
antibody 1 we need to enter numbers or letters proceeded by the $ symbol
(i.e. $1, or $parent1). In the Parents column of antibody 2, we need
to use the same value used in the $ column for antibody 1.

#### Date format


For date fields, the expected format is YYYY-MM-DD.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html_6

### Register storage positions and samples in the same XLS file


A sample and its storage position can be registered
together, as shown in the template provided above:


- The info in the $ column of the sample spreadsheet should
match the Parents column in Storage Positions spreadsheet.
In the $ column you can enter numbers or letters proceeded by the $
symbol (i.e. $1, $2 or $parent1, $parent2).

### Batch registration via TSV template file


- Select TSV Batch Register Objects from the More drop-down menu

- Select the Object type (E.g. Sample or Storage)

- Download the template file and fill in the relevant information

- Upload the file


#### Rules to follow to fill in the template .tsv file


- Identifiers:",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html_7

### Batch registration via TSV template file



Identifiers are given by /SPACE code/PROJECT code/OBJECT
code, e.g /MATERIALS/EQUIPMENT/INS1. Users can provide
their own identifiers, or these can be automatically generated
by openBIS.
To have identifiers automatically generated by openBIS,
completely remove the identifier column from the file.

- Lists. In fields that have lists to choose from (called
Controlled Vocabularies), the code of the term needs to be
entered. Term codes can be seen under Utilities -> Vocabulary
Browser.

- Parents. Use the following syntax to enter parents:
identifier1, identifier2, identifier3.

- Parents annotations. Use the following syntax to annotate
parents:
identifier:xxx;COMMENTS:xxxx\identifier:yyy;COMMENTS:yyyy. Where
COMMENTS is the property used for the annotation in this case
(to be replaced with the actual property used).

- Date fields. The expected syntax for dates is YYYY-MM-DD.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_inventory-of-materials-and-methods.html_8

### Advantages of XLS batch registration vs the old batch registration


- XLS batch registration uses labels instead of codes in the column
headers in the template file.

- Fields which are Controlled Vocabularies can use labels instead of
codes.

- The template can be used as it is, and no modifications are
necessary by removing the identifier column, as it was in case of
the old batch registration.

- Upload of samples and storage positions can now be performed using
single template file.

The old batch register mode is being maintained for backward
compatibility and will be phased out.

protocol were modified. These modifications can be edited in the
local copy of the protocol, while the template is left untouched.


To create a local copy under the current Experiment of a template protocol stored in the Inventory:


- Add a protocol as parent.

- From the Operations dropdown in the parents table select Copy to Experiment.

- Provide the Object code for the new protocol.

Tools For Analysis Of Data Stored In Openbis,https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-users/tools-for-analysis-of-data-stored-in-openbis.html,"## Jupyter Notebooks


Jupyter notebooks are web applications that combine text, code and
output (https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter supports
over 40 programming languages.


Jupyter notebooks can be used to analyze data stored in openBIS.


It is possible to connect to a JupyterHub server and launch Jupyter
notebooks directly from the openBIS interface. This feature is not
available by default, but needs to be enabled and configured by a
system admin. JupyterHub docker containers are available from our
download page: openBIS
download.
Further documentation can be found here: JupyterHub for
openBIS

### How to use Jupyter notebooks from openBIS



If you get a similar error as the one shown below when you try to launch
a notebook from an entity, you need to start the JupyterHub server by
going to the main menu Utilities -> Jupyter Workspace. This
error appears when the JupyterHub server is restarted (e.g. after an
upgrade), because the user profile needs to be recreated.


If you go to the Jupyter workspace, the user profile is re-created on
the server. After this, you can open a notebook from any entity of the
openBIS hierarchy as explained above (Space, Project,
Experiment/Collection, Object, Dataset).

Jupyter notebooks can also be launched from the main menu, under
Utilities, as shown below.


Note: if you use SSO for authentication (eg. Switch aai), the first
time you want to work with a Jupyter notebook, you first need to open
the Jupyter Workspace and then launch a notebook from wherever you
want to open it.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_tools-for-analysis-of-data-stored-in-openbis.html_1

### How to use Jupyter notebooks from openBIS



When you launch a notebook from the New Jupyter Notebook in the main
menu under Utilities, it is necessary to enter:


- The dataset(s) needed for the analysis.

- The owner of the Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are saved
back to openBIS as datasets, and these belong either to an
Experiment/Collection or to an Object. The owner is the
Experiment/Collection or Object where the notebook should be
stored.

- The directory name. This is the name of the folder that will be
created on the JupyterHub server.

- Notebook name. This is the name of the Jupyter notebook.


Jupyter notebooks can also be opened from a Project, Experiment,
Experimental Step choosing the corresponding option in the More
drop down menu. When opening notebooks from an Experiment or
Experimental Step, all connected datasets are automatically selected.
If some are not needed, they can be deselected.",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_tools-for-analysis-of-data-stored-in-openbis.html_2

### Overview of Jupyter notebook opened from openBIS.


The Jupyter notebooks running on the JupyterHub server for openBIS
support the following kernels: Bash, Octave, Python 2, Python 3, R,
SoS (Script of Scripts).


When you open a Jupyter notebook from openBIS, the default kernel used
is Python 3, but you can change to another language as shown below.

The Jupyter notebook opened from the openBIS interface contains some
pre-filled cells. All cells need to be run. The information of two cells
should be modified: Name of the dataset where the notebook will be
stored and Notes (in red below).


If you are running a JupyterHub version released after July 2021
(available at
https://hub.docker.com/u/openbis)
you do not need to enter username and password, as authentication uses
the openBIS session token.

If your session token is not automatically renewed you will see a long
error message when you try to retrieve information of a dataset. At the
bottom of the  error message you can see:

In such case, the session token can be manually entered in the cell as
shown below:

The session token can be copied from the User Profile under the
Utilities Main Menu in the ELN.


Enter the session token, run the cell above and then move to the next
cell to get the dataset(s) information.

Alternatively you can go to the Jupyter Workspace under Utilities
and restart the server.

Your script should be written in the section named Process your data
here, that contains one empty cell (see below). You can, of course, add
additional cells.


After the analysis is done, the notebook can be saved back to openBIS,
by running the last few cells which contain the information about where
the notebook will be stored (as shown below).",en_latest_user-documentation_general-users_tools-for-analysis-of-data-stored-in-openbis.html_4

The last pre-filled cell in the notebook, contains the information on
where to upload the Jupyter notebook in openBIS. After you run this
cell, you can go back to the ELN interface, refresh the webpage and you
will see your Jupyter notebook uploaded to the Object or Experiment you
specified. By default the Jupyter notebook are save to datasets of type
ANALYSIS_NOTEBOOK. If you prefer to use a different type, you can edit
the pre-filled cell shown above.


### Using a local Jupyter installation with openBIS


It is also possible to use a local Jupyter installation with openBIS. In
this case, it is possible to download an extension for JupyterLab that
adds 3 buttons to a default notebook:


- connect to an openBIS instance;

- download datasets from the openBIS instance;

- upload the notebook to openBIS.
